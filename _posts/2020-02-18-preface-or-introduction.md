title: Preface or Introduction
---
Very similiar to the foreword, however this one is written by the author.

In some fiction novels, the preface is used like a small chapter to give a scene that's suppossed to grab the readers' attention. It might be something like a suicide note by the victim that the main character, i.e. detective, spends the entire book trying to figure who killed him/her. Or, it could be a short scene were the main villain, i.e. assassin, is given their orders by a shady guy on the phone.

# Libretto Book - Jekyll Theme for Authors
Libretto Book is an updated version of the [Libretto theme by ferrolho](https://github.com/ferrolho/jekyll-theme-libretto).
I've changed the design a bit to make this theme more suitable for books, i.e. reverse the posts list, added author, etc.

To use it, go ahead and click the "Use Template" button!

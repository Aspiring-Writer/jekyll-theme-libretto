# Libretto Book - Jekyll Theme for Authors
Libretto Book is an updated version of the [Libretto theme by ferrolho](https://github.com/ferrolho/jekyll-theme-libretto).
I've changed the design a bit to make this theme more suitable for books, i.e. reverse the posts list, added author, etc.

To use it, go ahead and click the "Use Template" button!

## Usage
All you need to do is edit the `_config.yml` file and add your chapters to the `_chapters` collection. 

For the file naming of your chapters, make sure they're numbered in the order you want them to be in. I find it easier to have your metadata pages start with "0.#" (0.1, 0.2, 0.3, etc.) and your chapters start with numbers, but it's up to you.

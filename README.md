# Libretto Book - Jekyll Theme for Authors
Libretto Book is an updated version of the [Libretto theme by ferrolho](https://github.com/ferrolho/jekyll-theme-libretto).
I've changed the design a bit to make this theme more suitable for books, i.e. reverse the posts list, added author, etc.

To use it, go ahead and click the "Use Template" button!

## Usage

To start, click the [Use This Template button](https://github.com/Aspiring-Writer/libretto-book/generate) in the top right corner of the repo!

All you need to do is edit the `_config.yml` file and replace the chapters in the `_chapters` collection with your own.

**Note:** You may delete the images in the assets folder, they're just for the demo website.

For the file naming of your chapters, make sure they're numbered in the order you want them to be in. I find it easier to have your metadata pages start with "0.#" (0.1, 0.2, 0.3, etc.) and your chapters start with numbers, but it's up to you.

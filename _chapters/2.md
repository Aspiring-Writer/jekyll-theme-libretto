title: Epilogue
---
This is another optional page placed after your last chapter. It's shorter than your chapters and just gives a nice ending to your book. A lot of times it takes place a little while into the future when everything has calmed down (unless it's part of a thriller or mystery novel, then it might hint to another mystery). It could also be a small scene from a character that isn't your main character(s).

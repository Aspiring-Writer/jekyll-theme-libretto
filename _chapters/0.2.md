> This includes the declaration of copyright—meaning, who owns the copyright ( generally the authors)—and other types of credits such as illustrator, editorial staff, and indexer. Sometimes, this page has notes from the publisher and copyright acknowledgments—for books that contain reprinted material that requires permissions, such as excerpts, song lyrics, etc. The edition number (the number that represents the number of the edition and of the printing) is also on the copyright page. Some books will specifically note they are a “first edition.” With others, the edition is represented with a number. In those cases, a first edition would look like: 10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1. A second edition would look like: 10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2.
